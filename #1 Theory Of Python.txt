Q. What is Python?
-> programming language
-> Recent Version -> Python 3.10.0

Q. Where is Used?  
-> web development (server-side) [Ex. django,Flask], software development, mathematics, web scripting.
-> Data Analysis, Big Data, Mathslib, ..
-> Good Library Support Ex. Matplotlib, 
-> AI, Machine Learning, IOT

Q. Difference Between Python and other languages?
-> Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose. Ex. Java, C++, C

Q. Platform Independent?
-> Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi

Q. Interpreter or Compiler?
-> Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.

Q. Topics?
-> Data Types
-> Numbers
-> Casting
-> Strings
-> Booleans
-> Operators
-> Lists
-> Tuples
-> Sets
-> Dictionaries
-> If...Else
-> While Loops
-> For Loops
-> Functions
-> Lambda
-> Arrays
-> Classes/Objects
-> Inheritance
-> Iterators

Q. Where it can be downloaded?

Bytecode :  represents the fixed set of instucitons created by python developers representing all type of operators like all operations like sum, compare, memory related.
-> size of each byte code instuction is 1 byte or o bit
-> byte code instuction in .pyc file

Python Compiler: coverts source code into byte code.

Types of python compiler or Interpreter / Flavours of python:
CPython - official
Jpython or Jthon - python code though java
PyPy
RubyPython 
IronPython - .net code
StacklessPython 
Pythonxy
AnacondaPython 


Source code(High Level) (.py)-> compiler ->Byte code(.pyc) -> Run though PVM (Interpreter) -> Binary Code/ machine code -> Output

PVM - Python Virtual Machine - It's a Program
-> PVM have Interpreter 
-> We called PVM as Interpreter
-> Bytecode into machine code

Integrated development environment (IDE) 

Identifier
-> naming convention
-> letter, number, speical char, underscore(_)

Reserve Word

Constant
c , c++, java predefinded
python - no define - it can be changed
