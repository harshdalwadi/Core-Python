Q. What is Python?
-> programming language
-> Recent Version -> Python 3.11.0
-> it combines the features of C and Java programming language.

Q. Where is Used?  
-> web development (server-side) [Ex. django,Flask], software development, mathematics, web scripting.
-> Data Analysis, Big Data, Mathslib, ..
-> Good Library Support Ex. Matplotlib, 
-> AI, Machine Learning, IOT

Q. Difference Between Python and other languages?
-> Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose. Ex. Java, C++, C

Q. Platform Independent?
-> Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi

Q. Interpreter or Compiler?
-> Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.

Q. Where it can be downloaded?
-> https://www.python.org/downloads/


Bytecode : It represents the fixed set of instucitons created by python developers representing all type of operators like all operations like sum, compare, memory related.
-> size of each byte code instuction is 1 byte or 8 bit
-> byte code instuction in .pyc file

python - hello.py
byte - hello.pyc

Python Compiler: coverts source code into byte code.

Types of python compiler or Interpreter / Flavours of python:
CPython - official website
Jpython or Jthon - run though java platform
RubyPython 
IronPython - .net code
StacklessPython 
Pythonxy
AnacondaPython 

Source code(High Level) (.py)  ->  compiler  ->  Byte code(.pyc)  ->  Run though PVM (Interpreter)  ->  Binary Code/ machine code  ->  Output

PVM - Python Virtual Machine - It's a Program
-> PVM have Interpreter 
-> We called PVM as Interpreter
-> Bytecode into machine code

Integrated development environment (IDE) 

Q. What is Identifier in python?
-> naming convention
-> letter, number, speical char, underscore(_)
-> never starts with number
-> used to identify variable, function, function constant, class etc.
-> Reserved Words can not be used as identifiers.

Q. Constant?
-> In c , c++, java, values are predefinded
-> python - no constant  - it can be changed

Q. Variables and memory allocation in python
-> In python, a variable is considered as tag that us tied to some value. Python consider value as object.
Ex. a = 5 then compiler assign an address to 5 which is [5] => 10000 and tied 5 with tag a
-> if another variable a having the same value as 5 then it will directly taged to [5] which has an address 10000. 
-> Through this python can save extra memory.
-> If we define a = 5 and then a = 10 then a will automatically tie with 10 and garbage collector removes the value 5 and assigned address.
-> for getting id(address), write print(id(a))
