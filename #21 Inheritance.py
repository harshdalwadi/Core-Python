'''
Single Level Inheritance
-> Inheritance is defined as the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from some other class and use it whenever needed. Inheritance provides the following properties:
-> It represents real-world relationships well.
-> It provides reusability of code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
-> It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.

class A: #super class, parent classs, Base class 
	def feature1(self):
		print('feature1 is working')

	def feature2(self):
		print('feature2 is working')
 
class B(A): #Derived class, childclass
	def feature3(self):
		print('feature3 is working')

	def feature4(self):
		print('feature4 is working')

a = A()
a.feature1()
a.feature2()

b = B()
b.feature3()
b.feature4()

#-----------------------------------------
# inherit

a = B()
a.feature1()
a.feature2()
a.feature3()

# Object calling 
class A:
	def __init__(self):
		print("__init__ of A")

	def feature1(self):

class B(A):
	# def __init__(self):
	# 	print('__init__ of B')

	def feature4(self):
		print('feature4 is working')

b = B()

'''
-> IF we want to call both class's init method we use Super() method.
-> It refers to parent class. So we can access all the methods of parent class.

# ex.

class A:
	def __init__(self):
		print("__init__ of A")

	def feature1(self):
		print('feature1 is working')

class B(A):
	def __init__(self):
		super().__init__()
		print('__init__ of B')

	def feature4(self):
		print('feature4 is working')

b = B()

'''
-> If we have 2 super class -> that time object use MRO(Method Resolution Order) 
-> It will start from Left to Right.
-> Ex. 2 class.. A and B. So it will take A's init.
